We have created a service that organize anything, with anyone, from anywhere!

It works like a the ease-of-use of spreadsheets but gives the power of a database. 
Powerful filtering, sorting of records. Add attachments, long text notes, checkboxes, currency â€” even multiple select items.	
Collaborate with a team, all your changes are instantly synced across all devices and teammates.
You can even create and share a form and the responses will feed directly into Base.

Technology that we used:

 - Front-end:
React & Redux, ES6, Babel, Webpack, Semantic UI, Sass, Ramda

- Back-end:
Node.js & Express, Passport, MongoDB & Mongoose, Socket.io
